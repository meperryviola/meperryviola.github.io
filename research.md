Subfields of particular interest to me include <b> labor and public economics</b>. I am chiefly concerned with systemic inequality and the ways that policy may amplify or alleviate it. I generally gravitate towards questions related to children/families' health, education equity, and intergenerational mobility. 

I wrote my distinguished major thesis on the impacts of variable access to childcare subsidies on labor supply decisions and welfare program participation. In it, I examine the ways in which accessible childcare alters the screening effects of welfare work requirements and whether the presence of accessible childcare reduces the disincentives to work inherent to receipt of welfare benefits. Using the Supplemental Nutrition Access Program as my program of interest, I leverage the 2014 reauthorization of the Child Care Development Block Grant and accompanying nationwide changes to eligibility requirements and recertification periods. This research is ongoing so I decline to post a draft at this time. 


My 2021 Spring term paper, completed under supervision of L. Friedberg (UVA), was the recipient of UVA Economics Department award for "Best Public Policy Paper By An Undergraduate".
