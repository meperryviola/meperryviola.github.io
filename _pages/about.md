I am a research analyst for the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. My interests include labor and public economics, econometrics, technical communication, and labor organizing. In my spare time, I'm a violist and classical soprano.

I completed my BA with a Distinguished Major in Economics and secondary major in Mathematics in June 2022 from the University of Virginia. I am currently working on a MS in Economics at Drexel University part-time at night while continuing to work full-time at the Fed. 

I'm a native resident of Norfolk, Virginia and began my education at Old Dominion University in the fall of 2018, where I researched climate risk communication and simulation games as spaces for collective policy determination. I then transferred to the University of Virginia in the fall of 2019, where I developed a passion for econometric analysis.

I wrote my undergraduate thesis in Economics on the impacts of variable access to child care subsidies on the labor market behavior and welfare program participation of very low-income parents. I also worked with Leora Friedberg (UVA) and Tony Webb (The New School), assisting with research regarding retired couples and Social Security retired worker and surviving spouse benefits.

In my off-hours, I'm playing in the South Jersey Pops symphony or reading!
