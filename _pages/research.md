My research interests are varied! Subfields of particular interest to me include <b> labor and public economics</b>. I am chiefly concerned with systemic inequality and the ways that policy may amplify or alleviate it. I generally gravitate towards questions related to children/families' health, education equity, and social safety net program design. 

At the Fed, I work in the Empirical Macro section of the Research department but my work involves primarily micro-methods. I am working on a project exploring the relationship between immigration and refusal rates in the Current Population Survey and the divergence of headline employment numbers in the household (CPS) and payroll (CES) surveys. I am interested in estimating the degree to which undocumented immigration is driving increased non-response and, specifically, refusal in the CPS. I also hope to better understand how increasing refusal rates may be producing biased employment statistics because of the populations they are unable to capture. My conjecture is that increasing bias in the CPS employment statistics is a partial driver of the ongoing divergence between the household and payroll employment numbers, in conjunction with the currently-accepted driver: incorrect Census Population estimates. I hope to produce a reweighting process for the CPS that helps compensate for the structural under-capture of immigrants, providing a (hopefully more representative) picture of the labor market that reconciles household and payroll surveys. 

In my personal time, I am working on a project involving facilities condition data from the School District of Philadelphia. My project explores the intertemporal relationships between facilities quality and a variety of school-specific observables, including demographic makeup, catchment retention and enrollment flows, and student attendance. I am also incorporating real estate data to examine whether school facilities decline is capitalized in catchment home values.

I wrote my distinguished major thesis on the impacts of variable access to childcare subsidies on labor supply decisions and welfare program participation. In it, I examine the ways in which accessible childcare alters the screening effects of welfare work requirements and whether the presence of accessible childcare reduces the disincentives to work inherent to receipt of welfare benefits. Using the Supplemental Nutrition Access Program as my program of interest, I leverage the 2014 reauthorization of the Child Care Development Block Grant and accompanying nationwide changes to eligibility requirements and recertification periods. This research is ongoing so I decline to post a draft at this time. 


My 2021 Spring term paper, completed under supervision of L. Friedberg (UVA), was the recipient of UVA Economics Department award for "Best Public Policy Paper By An Undergraduate".

  I have extensive familiarity with CPS basic monthly and CPS ASEC data. I have also worked with the Fujita-Ramey expanded Palmer data that captures entire labor market histories of persons in 6 major US cities during the 1940s. I have compiled and cleaned a bespoke dataset of school facilies condition assessments in Philadelphia. This data is not yet made public but I hope to host it on my github and this site within the next 2 years. I have also worked with restricted-access Social Security data, the Health and Retirement Survey, American Community Survey, and a variety of macroeconomic indicator time series data.
